<p>Often referred to by students as the "NewDos," the group was was founded in 1990 by Burt Kann, Stephen Murray and Joanna Parsons, students at the University of Virginia. The group initially served as a temporary way to teach first years the basics of a cappella so they could audition for existing groups around Grounds. Once the NewDos came to their senses and realized what a terrible idea this was, they chose to stick together and have been exploding heads with awesomeness ever since. Today, the Newdos has become the University's premier co-ed a cappella group and holds auditions every Fall semester that are open to all interested U.Va. students.</p>
