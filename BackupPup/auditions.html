<h2>Audition FAQs</h2>
<h3><a href="#" onclick="faqFold(1)"><span id="100">&gt;</span> How do I audition for the New Dominions?</a></h3>
<p id="1" style="display:none">To audition for the New Dominions, sign up for an audition slot at the Lawn room listed above. Come to your audition a few minutes early to fill out an audition form. See the questions below for more specifics about the audition process.</p>
<p id="10"></p>
<h3><a href="#" onclick="faqFold(2)"><span id="200">&gt;</span> Why should I audition for the New Dominions?</a></h3>
<p id="2" style="display:none">As UVa's premier co-ed a cappella group, we are a fun, silly group of dynamic individuals. Music brings us together. Every semester we look for new students to add to our family. We're excited to hear you!</p>
<p id="20"></p>
<h3><a href="#" onclick="faqFold(3)"><span id="300">&gt;</span> How do auditions work?</a></h3>
<p id="3" style="display:none">We will start your audition with some warm-ups to test your vocal range. We may also ask you to do some sight-reading, blending or other exercises. Finally, you will sing your prepared solo for us. Don't be nervous! We're about the friendliest people you'll ever meet.</p>
<p id="30"></p>
<h3><a href="#" onclick="faqFold(4)"><span id="400">&gt;</span> What do I sing?</a></h3>
<p id="4" style="display:none">Come prepared with a verse and chorus of a popular song that showcases your voice. No Broadway or Disney, please. We sing popular music, so we'd like to hear you sing a song that fits with our repertoire. </p>
<p id="40"></p>
<h3><a href="#" onclick="faqFold(5)"><span id="500">&gt;</span> How do callbacks work?</a></h3>
<p id="5" style="display:none">At the end of auditions, we will post a callback list on the door of the audition Lawn room. We will then contact you with more specific callback information.</p>
<p id="50"></p>
<h3><a href="#" onclick="faqFold(6)"><span id="600">&gt;</span> How big of a time commitment is the New Dominions?</a></h3>
<p id="6" style="display:none">Like any a cappella group on Grounds, the New Dominions is a pretty big time commitment. We rehearse twice a week for a few hours at a time. We also have frequent gigs both on- and off-Grounds. It is definitely possible to be in involved in other organizations on Grounds – we all are – but Newdos must be a priority. </p>
<p id="60"></p>
<h3><a href="#" onclick="faqFold(7)"><span id="700">&gt;</span> Any other questions?</a></h3>
<p id="7" style="display:none">Shoot us an email on our contact page. Thanks — we can't wait to hear you!</p>
